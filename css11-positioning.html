        <p>In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. (Prior to this, metallurgy was not advanced enough to provide
            metal
            which was strong enough to make small, light parts out of.) The pedals were attached directly to the front
            wheel
            with no freewheeling mechanism. Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel provided a
            much
            smoother ride than its predecessor.</p>
        <p>The front wheels became larger and larger as makers realized that the larger the wheel, the farther you
            could
            travel with one rotation of the pedals. For that reason, you would purchase a wheel as large as your leg
            length
            would allow. This machine was the first one to be called a bicycle ("two wheel"). These bicycles enjoyed a
            great
            popularity during the 1880s among young men of means. (They cost an average worker six month's pay.)</p>
        <div>
            Because the rider sat so high above the center of gravity, if the front wheel was stopped by a stone or rut
            in the road,
            or the sudden emergence of a dog, the entire apparatus rotated forward on its front axle and the rider,
            with
            his legs trapped under the handlebars, was dropped unceremoniously on his head. Thus the term "taking a
            header"
            came into being.
